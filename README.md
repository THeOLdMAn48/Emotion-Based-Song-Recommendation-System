# 🎵 Emotion-Based Song Recommendation System
📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered music recommendation system that suggests songs based on user emotions. Initially developed in Python, the previous version was uploaded to my GitHub profile. To enhance functionality and improve user experience, it is now being redeveloped using React.js (frontend) and Django (backend).

🚀 Features
Emotion Detection: Analyzes user emotions using facial expressions or text input.
Machine Learning Integration: Classifies emotions and maps them to suitable songs.
Spotify API Integration: Fetches and plays recommended songs in real-time.
Modern UI with React.js: Interactive and responsive design for smooth user experience.
Scalability & Performance: Improved backend handling with Django.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Django
Machine Learning: Python (Emotion Classification Model)
Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite
API Integration: Spotify API
