# Emotion-Based-Song-Recommendation-System
Initially developed this project in Python for emotion-based music recommendations and uploaded it to my GitHub. Now redeveloping it with React.js (frontend) and Django (backend) to enhance functionality and user experience. Uses machine learning and the Spotify API to analyze emotions and suggest suitable songs.
